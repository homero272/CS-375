# Assigment 1
While researching the different websites of WebGL examples, particularly found
ShaderToy to contain cooler graphics. Specifically, I thought this [Jupiter and IO](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXjSRc)
piece of work to be cool. The rotation/animation of Jupiter and its moon IO is very detailed and texturized. The sky behind
it only adds more uniqueness to the graphic. The fast winds on Jupiter are also mimicked in the graphic showing the fast gusts 
of winds on the surface of the planet.
