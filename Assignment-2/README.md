# Assignment 2
This project explores the basic tools needed to render objects 
onto the viewport. The shapes rendered include 

1. a sphere which is changing in size (scale)
2. a cone which rotates at a certain angle
3. a axes that is also rotating. 

The rendered objects are also rendered with different colors.
In order for them to fit within the viewport, a series of transformations
were pushed to the matrix stack in the *correct* order in order to 
render the shapes appropiately.
