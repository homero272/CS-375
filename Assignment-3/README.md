# Assignment #3: Cubes

## For this project, I created cubes using 3 different methods
Mehtod #1 (Basic Cube)
- this uses 36 vertices and just connects vertices via 
  the call to draw array

## Method#2 (Indexed Cube)
- this uses 8 vertices and employs a index array which
  carefully connects the vertices appropiately to generate
  the cube via the method draw elements


## Method #3 (Experimental Cube)
- this uses 14 vertices in order to use the primitive gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP
  connects the vertices via the method of draw arrays
